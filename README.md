# üéÆ Snake AI: Reinforcement Learning in Action

## üöÄ Business Scenario (or Project Context)

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful technique for training intelligent agents to make decisions in dynamic environments. This project demonstrates how Deep Q-Learning (DQN) can be applied to teach an AI agent to play the classic Snake game. The trained AI learns optimal strategies to maximize its score while avoiding collisions. This project is valuable for:

- **AI Enthusiasts:** Understanding the fundamentals of reinforcement learning
- **Game Developers:** Exploring AI-driven gameplay mechanics
- **Researchers:** Experimenting with RL algorithms in controlled environments
- **Educators:** Demonstrating practical applications of machine learning

## üß† Problem Statement

Teaching an AI agent to play Snake involves solving several challenges:

- **Decision-Making:** How does the agent decide the next move (left, right, or straight)?
- **Exploration vs Exploitation:** Balancing between trying new actions and leveraging learned strategies
- **Reward Design:** Creating a reward system that encourages efficient gameplay
- **Generalization:** Ensuring the agent performs well across different scenarios

This project addresses these challenges by implementing a Deep Q-Learning model to train the AI agent.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Approach

The project uses Deep Q-Learning (DQN) combined with Pygame to simulate and train the Snake AI. The workflow includes:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Environment Setup**

- **Game Environment:** Developed using Pygame to simulate the Snake game
- **State Representation:** Encoded as 11 binary values:
  - Danger ahead, danger to the right, danger to the left
  - Current direction (up, down, left, right)
  - Food location relative to the snake's head (up, down, left, right)
- **Reward System:**
  - +10 for eating food
  - -10 for collisions
  - Small negative reward for each step to encourage efficiency

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Development**

- **Neural Network Architecture:**
  - Input Layer: 11 neurons (state representation)
  - Hidden Layer: 256 neurons with ReLU activation
  - Output Layer: 3 neurons (possible actions: left, straight, right)
- **Training Process:**
  - **Exploration vs Exploitation:** Controlled by epsilon-greedy strategy
  - **Experience Replay:** Stores past experiences to stabilize learning
  - **Model Saving:** Best-performing models are saved during training
- **Optimization:** Used PyTorch's Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Interactive Dashboard Development**

- **Streamlit App:** Created an interactive dashboard to showcase the AI gameplay and provide technical insights
- **Features:**
  - Watch the AI play Snake in real-time
  - Explore the neural network architecture and state representation
  - View training progress and future work ideas
- **Video Showcase:** Embedded gameplay video for quick reference
